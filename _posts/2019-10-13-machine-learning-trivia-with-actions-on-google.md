Wouldn't it be nice if 10 minutes before a data science interview, Google Assistant asks you all MCQ's about a concept like Decision Tree.

While experimenting with "Actions on Google", I created a small Trivia on Decision Trees.

Do check it out by opening Google Assistant & saying "Ask Decision Tree Trivia" & the MCQ's will start. 


# How I created my first app on action on Google:-
  - Create a new project
  - Choose template option
  - Choose your any quiz/trivia option
  - Name Your trivia and edit the sheet with quiz
  - Test the app
  - Add details like privacy policy, about your quiz, logo etc
  - Submit for review

This was just an experiment with 15 questions that I created. Based on your feedback, I would love to create more such trivia's.

Feel free to drop in your feedback & share it with your network.
