This Machine Learning basics video will help you understand what is Machine Learning, what are the types of Machine Learning - supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, how Machine Learning works with simple examples, and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various industries. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results. Machine learning is starting to reshape how we live, and it’s time we understood what it is and why it matters. Now, let us deep dive into this short video and understand the basics of Machine Learning.
