Let's create a simple XOR based Neural Network with TensorFlow 2.0.

Google Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the Cloud. In this episode of Coding TensorFlow, I'll shows you how to create a simple XOR based neural networks right in your browser, without having to worry about installing any kind of runtime.
