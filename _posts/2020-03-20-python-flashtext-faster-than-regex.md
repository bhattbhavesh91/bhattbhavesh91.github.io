---

Keyword extraction is a common problem that most data science folks encounter when working with huge text data.

While playing around with a big text dataset, I discovered an amazing library called FlashText. 

FlashText is a library faster than Regular Expressions for NLP tasks for bigger datasets which reduces days of replacement computation time to minutes. If you deal with this kind of problem of text cleaning & modification then, I would really suggest you try the library!

In this video, Iâ€™ll show you how you can leverage the power of FlashText.

I hope you all like it ðŸ™‚
