Bayes theorem is magical. We both can start with two different belief & can reach to same conclusion by continuously updating our believes based on the available evidence. This is a small video which explains how Bayes theorem works and how is it useful in Machine Learning!

Bayes' Theorem is an incredibly powerful theorem in probability that allows us to relate P(A|B) to P(B|A). This is helpful because we often have an asymmetry where one of these conditional probabilities is easy to compute and the other is not. It let's us treat compute how to update our probabilities given new information. 

The formula: P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)
