Excel allows us to filter sort with the help of a button click but all these manipulations require some good amount of code when we are working with python and pandas dataframe. Qgrid is a Jupyter notebook widget which uses SlickGrid to render pandas DataFrames within a Jupyter notebook. This allows you to explore your DataFrames with intuitive scrolling, sorting, and filtering controls, as well as edit your DataFrames by double clicking cells.
