Scikit Learn's preprocessing module has a StandardScaler function which helps us scale our data between -1 to 1. However, this process is done during the preprocessing stage of the model building. How do we scale the inputs at prediction? Do we have the access of the scale and mean of the scaled inputs. I'll answer all the question in the following video.
