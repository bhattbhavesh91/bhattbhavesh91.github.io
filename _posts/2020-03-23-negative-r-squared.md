description: In this tutorial, I will show you that R-squared calculated for Linear Regression projects can have a negative value or a value less than 0.

R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model.

There is a common misconception that R-squared cannot be negative.

In this video, I'll explain that when the predictions of the linear regression model are worse than the simple mean of the target variable then R-squared values are negative.

I hope you all like it ðŸ™‚
