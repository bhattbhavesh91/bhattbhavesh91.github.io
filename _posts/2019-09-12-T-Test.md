T-test, is used to determine whether the means of two groups are equal to each other. The assumption for the test is that both groups are sampled from normal distributions with equal variances. The null hypothesis is that the two means are equal, and the alternative is that they are not. This tutorial covers the basics of performing t-tests in Python.

In this video we aim to see how T-test can be implemented in Python.
