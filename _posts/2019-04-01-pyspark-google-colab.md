PySpark is the interface that gives access to Spark using the Python programming language. PySpark is an API developed in python for spark programming and writing spark applications in Python style, although the underlying execution model is the same for all the API languages. Colab by Google is based on Jupyter Notebook which is an incredibly powerful tool that leverages google docs features. Since it runs on google server, we don't need to install anything in our system locally, be it Spark or deep learning model. 

In this video, I'll show you how you can create PySpark DataFrames with PySpark in Google Colab.
