description: In this video, I'll show you how you can speedup Python Pandas with RAPIDS GPU-Accelerated Dataframe Library called cuDF on Google Colab!

Pandas is the go-to library for processing data in Python. Itâ€™s easy to use and quite flexible when it comes to handling different types and sizes of data. It has tons of different functions that make manipulating data a breeze.

But there is one drawback: Pandas is slow for larger datasets.

The RAPIDS cuDF library is a GPU DataFrame manipulation library based on Apache Arrow that accelerates loading, filtering, and manipulation of data for model training data preparation. The RAPIDS GPU DataFrame provides a pandas-like API that will be familiar to data scientists, so they can now build GPU-accelerated workflows more easily.

In this video, I'll show you the speed up provided by cuDF.
