description: In this tutorial, I will show you how to implement an autoregressive model (AR model) for time series forecasting in Python from scratch.
---

Auto Regressive (AR) model is one of the most popular time series model. In this model, each value is regressed to its previous observations. 

AR(1) is the first order auto-regression meaning that the current value is based on the immediately preceding value.

So, In this video, I'll implement the Auto-regressive (AR(1)) model from scratch in Python.
