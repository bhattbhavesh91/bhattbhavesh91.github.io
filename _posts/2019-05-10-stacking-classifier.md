Stacking is an ensemble learning technique to combine multiple classification models via a meta-classifier. The individual classification models are trained based on the complete training set; then, the meta-classifier is fitted based on the outputs -- meta-features -- of the individual classification models in the ensemble. The meta-classifier can either be trained on the predicted class labels or probabilities from the ensemble.

Let's understand how a stacking classifier works and create a simple stacking classifier in Python.
