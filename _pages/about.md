<!---Hi I’m Bhavesh, I studied electronics engineering but I’ve been interested in machine learning. I made this website to post some of the videos that I’ve created and to serve as a portfolio of sorts. Besides that I enjoy photography, cricket.

I am a Data Scientist based out of Mumbai, India. Currently working at Cuddle.ai where I focus on building time series anomaly detection algorithms. My primary interests include Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning.

I am a **Google Developer Expert (GDE)** in Machine Learning since October 2019.

I did my postgraduate degree in Embedded Systems at at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani in 2016.

In August 2018, I was selected to be an instructor at Greyatom & since then I have been working with Data Science aspirants to help them transition into a Data Science Career. 

I have also reviewed multiple machine learning books by giving continuous feedback to the author on each topic to make the book more intuitive & interesting for students. 

In order to give back to the community from which I learnt so much I started creating videos on YouTube & currently I have close to 100 videos & **8000 subscribers**.
