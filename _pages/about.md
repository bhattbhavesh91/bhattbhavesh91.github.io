I am a Senior Data Scientist based out of Mumbai, India. My primary interests include Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning.

I have designed & deployed multiple machine learning & deep learning models that have had a significant business impact.

I am a **Google Developer Expert (GDE)** in Machine Learning since October 2019.

I have also been awarded the prestigious **40 Under 40 Data Scientist award** by Analytics India Magazine in January 2020.

I have participated in multiple hackathons. Additionally, I have secured **Top 1%** rank (82) with over 8600+ submissions for the Food Demand Forecasting Hackathon - A Machine Learning Hackathon Dataset released by an American professional services firm, Genpact.

I did my postgraduate degree in Embedded Systems at at **Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani** in 2016.

I have worked with multiple EdTech startups in delivering sessions & developing their machine learning course curriculum. I have also closely worked with Data Science aspirants to help them transition into a Data Science Career. 

I have also reviewed multiple machine learning books by giving continuous feedback to the author on each topic to make the book more intuitive & interesting for students. 

In order to give back to the community from which I learnt so much I started creating videos on YouTube & currently I have close to 110 videos & **10k+ subscribers**.
