## Mentoring at Build for Digital India (24th Jan 2020)

It was an enriching experience mentoring some interesting projects as part of 
[Build for Digital India](https://events.withgoogle.com/buildfordigitalindia/){:target="_blank"} program by Google & Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology to offer engineering students a platform to develop market-ready, technology-based solutions that address key social problems.

I was responsible for the following during this mentorship:
- Provide the teams with constructive feedback to improve their pitch.
- Discuss technical challenges and provide solution approaches.
